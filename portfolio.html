    </figure>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> OTR Solutions developed a Fuel Finder tool for its mobile app, enabling clients to locate discounted diesel truck stops. The tool led to a 50% increase in card usage and sales growth over six months.</p>

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p>OTR had aggregated competitive fuel discounts across the US but lacked a way for clients to find participating truck stops. The Fuel Finder provided real-time discount information, driving user engagement and fuel card usage.</p>

    <h4>Pain Points</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clients had no way to find discounted truck stops.</li>
        <li>Competing fuel cards, while offering smaller discounts and more limited coverage, made it easier for users to identify discount locations (e.g., Love's discount cards are straightforward as they only apply to Love's truck stops).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I was the Lead Product Manager responsible for the end-to-end lifecycle of the Fuel Finder. My prior experience launching the Fuel Desk informed the productâ€™s development, allowing me to align business goals with user needs effectively.</p>

    <h4>Methodology/Tools</h4>
    <p>We leveraged existing card swipe data and followed Agile methods to build the tool, ensuring rapid iteration and user feedback integration.</p>

    <h4>Key Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive map of discounted fuel stops with last-swipe pricing data.</li>
        <li>Search functionality based on location, route, or truck stop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Metrics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>15%+ increase:</strong> Card loads, usage, and gallons purchased within the first two months.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced onboarding time:</strong> Time to first card swipe dropped from over 30 days to under 7 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes</h4>
    <p>The Fuel Finder transformed OTR's Fuel Card into a self-selling product, allowing the Fuel Desk to focus on support rather than outbound sales. This significantly improved operational efficiency and product adoption.</p>

    <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
    <p>Leveraging internal data can save significant costs. For example, we used access to internal card swipe data to avoid a $50K/year data subscription. Maximizing existing resources is invaluable for product development.</p>

        <li>Performance tracking and monitoring to ensure system reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Metrics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial time savings:</strong> 100 invoices were approved in under 1 minute, saving the team more than 8 hours per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance improvements:</strong> After the microservice update, page load times while invoice approval ran dropped to under 4 seconds system-wide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes</h4>
    <p>The feature scaled successfully from handling 3,500 invoices daily to over 7,500 by the time I left OTR. It became a core feature, enabling OTR to efficiently manage larger clients and reducing manual workloads for the Account Team.</p>

    <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
    <p>Building features with scalability in mind is essential, especially as client needs grow. The transition to a microservice architecture ensured long-term system performance. Monitoring system metrics and proactively addressing bottlenecks are critical for maintaining user satisfaction.</p>
