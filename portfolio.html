    </figure>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> OTR Solutions developed a Fuel Finder tool for its mobile app, enabling clients to locate discounted diesel truck stops. The tool led to a 50% increase in card usage and sales growth over six months.</p>

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p>OTR had aggregated competitive fuel discounts across the US but lacked a way for clients to find participating truck stops. The Fuel Finder provided real-time discount information, driving user engagement and fuel card usage.</p>

    <h4>Pain Points</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clients had no way to find discounted truck stops.</li>
        <li>Competing fuel cards, while offering smaller discounts and more limited coverage, made it easier for users to identify discount locations (e.g., Love's discount cards are straightforward as they only apply to Love's truck stops).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>I was the Lead Product Manager responsible for the end-to-end lifecycle of the Fuel Finder. My prior experience launching the Fuel Desk informed the product’s development, allowing me to align business goals with user needs effectively.</p>

    <h4>Methodology/Tools</h4>
