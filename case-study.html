                <div class="case-study-content">
                    <p><strong>For Clients:</strong> The existing invoice submission form was inefficient and lacked user-friendly design elements, contributing to user dissatisfaction. The app’s limited functionality only allowed invoice submissions and broker checks, leaving most user needs unmet.</p>
                    <p><strong>For OTR:</strong> The outdated app structure created a barrier to client onboarding, impacting acquisition and retention rates. Freight owner-operators required a mobile solution optimized for submitting and reviewing invoices efficiently while on the road. Without app adoption, users submitted invoices through email, creating operational inefficiencies as internal teams had to process data manually.</p>

			        <p>
			            The project involved cross-functional collaboration between Operations, Engineering, and Product teams.
            			The Vendor Payable Board (see <strong>Fig. 8</strong>) provided a centralized platform where Account Teams could easily manage

			        <p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>
			        <ul>
            			<li><strong>Time savings:</strong> Reduced account management need from over 2 hours to under 5 minutes per week.</li>
			            <li><strong>Increased payables:</strong> Grew from 75 open payables to 500 in six months.</li>
            			<li><strong>Retention:</strong> Clients using the program were 90% more likely to remain with OTR after six months.</li>

			        <p><strong>Business Value:</strong></p>
			        <p>
			            The Vendor Payable Board became a critical feature for retaining clients and enabling account 
						teams to focus on strategic priorities, aligning with OTR’s mission to support small trucking businesses. Long-term, this service could evolve into 
			            a standalone subscription offering or be integrated into a SaaS model contract structure.

			            <li><strong>High Volume of Invoices:</strong> Certain large clients submitted hundreds of invoices daily.</li>
			            <li><strong>Manual Workflow:</strong> Approval required opening each invoice, changing its status, and saving the changes (see <strong>Fig. 10</strong>)—a time-consuming and monotonous process.</li>
			            <li><strong>Disproportionate Impact:</strong> High-volume clients consumed disproportionate time and resources compared to smaller clients.</li>

			        <p><strong>Initial Implementation:</strong></p>
			        <ul>
			            <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Operations teams tracked time spent on manual approvals, revealing an average of 14 minutes per 100 invoices for large clients. This data quantified the business case for automation.</li>
			            <li><strong>Development:</strong> Collaborated with a mid-level engineer to architect and build the solution, integrating it seamlessly into the existing UI to ensure user adoption (see <strong>Fig. 11</strong>).</li>
			            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Conducted Beta tests with copied production data alongside operations teams to validate functionality and accuracy.</li>

                    <p>Extu set out to redesign the GoTu Rewards signup process with the following objectives:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Streamline the Process:</strong> Break the long form into manageable steps and integrate modern user-centric features like a progress tracker and MELISSA address auto-fill API to enhance usability (see <strong>Fig. 18</strong>).</li>
                        <li><strong>Increase Lead Capture:</strong> Focus on collecting minimal but essential user information (email, password, company name) in the first step to ensure lead generation (see <strong>Fig. 19</strong>).</li>
                        <li><strong>Industry Best Practices:</strong> The new signup flow aimed to deliver a user-friendly experience that positioned GoTu Rewards as a modern, professional platform capable of supporting enterprise needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aspirational Goal:</strong> Build a framework that could scale across enterprise loyalty platforms without requiring additional development effort.</li>
